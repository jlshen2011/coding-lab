# Machine Learning Reading List
Below is my personal reading list on a variety of topics of mordern machine learning. Different from many so-called "machine learning must-reads" you may find online which appears scaringly long and cubersome, I have read all of the listed books/papers/websites on this list and am sure that you would more or less benefit from it.
